# React 19 useSyncExternalStore Error Handling Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `useSyncExternalStore` hook in React 19. When a subscription function throws an error, the component may not update correctly, potentially leading to silent data inconsistencies.

## Bug Report

The `bug.js` file showcases the problem:  the subscription function sometimes throws an error, and the component's state doesn't reflect the error, leading to a non-reactive component state. 

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible solution using a `try...catch` block within the subscription to gracefully handle errors and update the component's state accordingly, ensuring that state reflects any errors.
