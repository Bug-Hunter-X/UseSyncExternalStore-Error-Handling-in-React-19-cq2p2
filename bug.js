In React 19, using the `useSyncExternalStore` hook with a subscription that throws an error can lead to unexpected behavior.  The error might not be caught properly, and the component may not re-render as expected, leading to stale data or silent failures. This is especially problematic if the error is intermittent or difficult to reproduce.
